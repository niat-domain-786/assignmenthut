                                <p> At Assignment Hut, satisfaction of students is our first priority. We understand that students might be in a situation where they would like to change or cancel their order. Therefore, we have designed our refund policy keeping in mind the needs of students. Please refer to the terms and conditions of this policy stated below: -</p>

                                <ol>
                                    <li> 1. If you decide to cancel your order before we have allocated a writer, then you can place another order of same value, free of cost. If the writer has already been assigned to your order, then no refund shall be applicable in that case. This is because the writer who starts working your task should receive payment for the work.</li> <br>
                                    <li> 2. If you were charged two times by mistake while placing an order on our website through PayPal, we will refund your extra payment to the original mode of payment, PayPal. Please email us both the payment receipts and we will refund the extra payment within seven working days.</li><br>
                                    <li> 3. The assignments are first checked by the experts before giving quote to the students. However, there are rare occasions when we are unable to allocate your order to one of our writers due to some medical emergency of writer or complexity of a specific task within the order. In such cases where we are unable to assign a writer to your order, you can place next order of the same value free of cost.</li><br>
                                    <li> 4. Please ensure that you provide all additional and supporting documents for doing the assignment at the time of placing the order as they are imperative to deliver top quality work. In case the student fails to provide additional documents, thereby leading to low grades, no refunds shall be applicable in that case.</li><br>
                                    <li> 5. Although it rarely happens that a student gets a fail in an assignment done by us. In that case, please provide us authentic proof of fail and detailed feedback within 30 days of order delivery date, and we shall refund you 50% of the order amount to your wallet within seven working days. Any complaints made after this period shall not be entertained. The basis for 50% refund is that we have already made full payment to the writer and it is not possible to get the payment back from them. However, to comply with our stringent quality requirements, we will immediately fire the writer from our organisation.</li><br>
                                    <li> 6. No refunds are applicable in case of urgent orders with delivery deadline within 24 hours.</li><br>
                                    <li> 7. No refunds are applicable in case where students use the 100% satisfaction guarantee policy.</li><br>
                                    <li> 8. Since all the payments are received electronically through PayPal, no cash refunds are applicable.</li>
                                </ol>
